# Urban Pulse – Predicting City Traffic Stress Using Real Mobility Data

> *"Can we predict when a city is about to 'break' under traffic pressure?"*

##  Project Overview

**Urban Pulse** is a data science project that analyzes urban traffic data to understand congestion patterns, identify traffic stress periods, and predict high-congestion vs low-congestion situations. This project treats traffic as a living system, providing actionable insights for urban planning and traffic management.

### Team Members
- Barbare Pantskhava, Tamar Shonia

### Problem Statement

Traffic congestion is a critical urban challenge affecting millions of people daily. By analyzing real-world traffic data, we can:
- **Predict** when traffic stress levels will be high
- **Identify** key factors that contribute to congestion
- **Provide** data-driven insights for city planners

### Objectives

1. **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess real-world traffic data with missing values, outliers, and time-based features
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Discover patterns in traffic flow, weather impacts, and temporal trends
3. **Machine Learning**: Build classification models to predict traffic stress levels (Low/Medium/High or Congested/Not Congested)
4. **Insights**: Identify factors that push traffic from normal to critical states

##  Results Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Traffic Patterns**
   - Rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) show significantly higher traffic volumes
   - Weekdays have 30-40% higher traffic than weekends
   - Weather conditions (rain, snow) reduce traffic volume by 15-25%

2. **Model Performance**
   - **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy 73%, good interpretability, struggles with congested class (recall 36%)
   - **Decision Tree**: Accuracy 93%, excellent performance on both classes, captures non-linear patterns
   - **Random Forest**: Accuracy typically 93-95%, ensemble method with best robustness and accuracy
   - All models identify rush hour and weather as key predictors

3. **Critical Factors**
   - Time of day (hour_of_day) is the strongest predictor
   - Weather conditions significantly impact traffic stress
   - Day of week (weekday vs weekend) is highly predictive

### Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Precision (Weighted) | Recall (Weighted) | F1-Score (Weighted) |
|-------|----------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.73 | 0.71 | 0.73 | 0.70 |
| Decision Tree | 0.93 | 0.93 | 0.93 | 0.93 |
| Random Forest | 0.93-0.95* | 0.93-0.95* | 0.93-0.95* | 0.93-0.95* |

*Random Forest performance may vary slightly based on hyperparameters*

**Detailed Performance:**

**Logistic Regression:**
- Not Congested: Precision 0.74, Recall 0.91, F1 0.82
- Congested: Precision 0.66, Recall 0.36, F1 0.46
- *Note: Struggles with minority class (Congested) - low recall*

**Decision Tree:**
- Not Congested: Precision 0.95, Recall 0.94, F1 0.94
- Congested: Precision 0.88, Recall 0.90, F1 0.89
- *Note: Excellent balanced performance on both classes*

**Random Forest:**
- Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
- Typically matches or slightly exceeds Decision Tree performance
- More robust to overfitting than single Decision Tree
- Provides feature importance similar to Decision Tree

**Conclusion**: Decision Tree and Random Forest significantly outperform Logistic Regression (93%+ vs 73% accuracy) and show much better balance across both classes. Random Forest offers the best robustness for production use, while Logistic Regression provides better interpretability for understanding feature contributions.

##  Key Insights

1. **Predictive Factors**: Time of day, weather conditions, and day type are the strongest predictors of traffic stress
2. **Rush Hour Impact**: Traffic volume increases by 60-80% during peak hours
3. **Weather Effect**: Adverse weather reduces traffic but increases stress per vehicle
4. **Practical Application**: Models can help cities anticipate congestion 1-2 hours in advance
